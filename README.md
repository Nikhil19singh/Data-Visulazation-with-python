# Data-Visulazation-with-python
# 💧 Water Pollution & Disease Visualization Project

This project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive visualizations on a dataset related to **water pollution levels and disease cases** across various regions.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Removed duplicates and handled missing values using median imputation
  - Renamed columns for consistency and readability

- **Data Visualization**
  - Histograms for pollutant distribution
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
  - Bar charts showing regional disease spread
  - Boxplots for pollution levels across regions
  - Interactive scatter plot using Plotly for dynamic insights

- **Statistical Analysis**
  - Correlation analysis between contamination and disease cases
  - Regional comparison of average pollution levels and disease incidence

## 📁 Dataset Used

The dataset `water_pollution_disease.csv` contains information such as:

- Region  
- Contaminant Level (ppm)  
- Disease Cases  
- Population  
- Other relevant environmental factors

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **pandas** for data manipulation  
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for static visualizations  
- **plotly** for interactive visualizations
